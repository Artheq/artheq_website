        This Privacy Policy explains how ArthEQ.com, Inc. (&quot;ArthEQ&quot;, &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) collects, uses, and
        discloses information about you when you access or use our websites, mobile application, and

        customer service team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us. This policy
        does not apply to subscription eligibility information we receive from and process on behalf of
        our enterprise business customers and partners (defined as &quot;Customer Data&quot; in the applicable
        agreement), but this Privacy Policy does apply to your use of the Services, regardless of your
        subscription or account type. Additional information for individuals in the EEA, UK, and
        Switzerland, as well as for California residents, can be found at the end of this Privacy Policy.
        We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you
        by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with
        additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website homepage or sending you a
        notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services
        or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices
        available to you.
        Collection of Information
        Information You Provide to Us
        We collect information when you register for an account, participate in interactive features (like

        participate in a contest or promotion, make a purchase, communicate with us via social media
        sites, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The information you may
        provide includes your name, email, password, street address, payment method information,
        goals, previous meditation experience, moods, and reflections you provide during check-ins,
        feedback and survey responses, and other information about you included within your messages
        to us or otherwise provided via the Services. Some users also provide health-related information
        in connection with providing feedback or other messages to us, and we process that information
        consistent with the purpose for which it was provided.
